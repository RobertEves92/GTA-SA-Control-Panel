## How to contribute to GTA:SA - Control Panel

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/RobertEves92/GTA-SA-Control-Panel-CSharp/issues). As this is newly created/released it is unlikely that any bugs found will have already been reported, however not impossible.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/RobertEves92/GTA-SA-Control-Panel-CSharp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) using the template provided. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of GTA:SA - Control Panel will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you want to, or intend to, add a new feature or change an existing one?**

1. Start writing code, and submit a pull request!
**OR**
2. Open a [feature request](https://github.com/RobertEves92/GTA-SA-Control-Panel-CSharp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D)
